/**
 * Creates a JSON Web Token (JWT) using the ECDSA algorithm.
 *
 * This function takes a JSON Web Key (JWK) and JWT data, encodes them,
 * and signs the token using the specified algorithm and hash function.
 *
 * In the Web Push protocol, the VAPID JWT includes an `exp` (expiration) claim
 * that specifies the token's validity period. According to the VAPID specification,
 * the `exp` value must not exceed 24 hours from the time of the request. If it does,
 * the push service (like FCM) will reject the request with a 403 Forbidden error.
 *
 * @param {JsonWebKey} jwk - The JSON Web Key used for signing the JWT.
 * @param {JwtData} jwtData - The data to be included in the JWT payload.
 * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that resolves to the signed JWT as a string.
 *
 * @throws {Error} Throws an error if the key import or signing process fails.
